<h3>Initiation</h3>
After some time digesting other Digital Gardens and talking to my good friend, I decided to go through the process of creating this blog. I Have some experience with "Second Brains" having used Notion with Thomas Franks template, as well as some experience with building websites.
<p>Looking through the options for building this, I wanted to try something new and rehash old skills so I went with Eleventy (a Static Site Generator or SSG). This involved a few steps for installing the software and IDE (I went with VS Codium as it has the benefits of VS Code without the Microsoft). I chose Eleventy over other options purely for the fact it compiles fast, I'm not experienced enough to know if this was the best option for me, but I'm not fussed either way.</p>
<p>I plan on using this website as a kind of live journal and notes, to express my opinions and thoughts in an evolving way where I can build upon areas as I learn more. I also want to adhere to making new posts as easily as possible, and as accessible as possible - meaning the site will only use assets that I provide, where possible, and should stand the test of time as it is Markdown.</p>
<p>I may review and try alternate solutions as this experiment progresses. The more I look at things, the more Notion seems like the easiest option.</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Add tags to posts</li>
    <li>Add planted and last tended (dates)</li>
    <li>Current growth (seedling, budding, ever green)</li>
</ul>
